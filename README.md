# weather-predication using machine learning
purpose(objective of the project)
1.Purpose of this project is to predict the temperature using different algorithms like linear regression, random forest regression, and Decision tree regression.   
2. The output value should be numerically based on multiple extra factors like maximum temperature, minimum temperature, cloud cover, humidity, and sun hours in a day, precipitation, pressure and wind speed.
